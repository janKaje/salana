It also has several optional modules that are more general-purpose.

Setup
-----

When you invite Salana to your server, it will send a message to the first channel it can find that allows it to send a message. The message will ask if you want this server to implement toki pona or pa mu features. If it cannot send the message, it will default to toki pona.
